In this page we list some example ini files are explain their particularities.


Trigger time
------------
The :code:`trigger-time` data-generation method is the easiest way to run on an
event or particular time of interest. Simply specify the GPS trigger time in
the ini file, for example here is an ini file for running on GW150914

.. literalinclude:: ../example_ini_files/GW150914.ini


Running on GPS times
--------------------

Here is an example ini file for running on a list of GPS times

.. literalinclude:: ../example_ini_files/gps_times.ini

Note, the ini file provides an argument :code;`gps-file` which points to a file
`gps_times.txt` which is a simple list of the GPS times to use. Here are
its contents:

.. literalinclude:: ../example_ini_files/gps_times.txt

Running on injections in Gaussian noise
---------------------------------------

:code:`bilby_pipe` provides a set of tools for creating and analysing an
injection set. Here is an example of an ini file for generating and analysing
three injections. The injections are generated by drawing :code:`n-injection`
samples from the prior.

.. literalinclude:: ../example_ini_files/bbh_injection.ini

The prior is specified by a bilby prior file :code:`bbh_reduced.prior`:

.. literalinclude:: ../example_ini_files/bbh_reduced.prior

Running :code:`bilby_pipe` with this ini file

.. code-block:: console

   $ bilby_pipe bbh_injection.ini

will produce a bilby_pipe :code:`injection_file`. This can be found in the
:code:`data` directory of the output. It is a simple pandas dataframe stored
in the json format containing the parameters of the injection(s).

Running on GraceDb events
-------------------------

The :code:`bilby_pipe` code itself does not run directly on gracedb event IDs.
Instead, we provide a command line tool :code:`bilby_pipe_gracedb` which
generates ini files and automates the process of determining the relevant
prior (the output prior file can subsequently be edited as the user wants).
