Install bilby_pipe from source
------------------------------

:code:`bilby_pipe` is developed and tested with for Python 3+. In the
following, we assume you have a working python installation, `python pip
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing)>`_,
and `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_.

Clone the repository and then install the software:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone git@git.ligo.org:lscsoft/bilby_pipe.git
   $ cd bilby_pipe/
   $ python setup.py install

Once you have run these steps, you have :code:`bilby_pipe` installed.

.. note::
   If you do not have a git.ligo account, and recieve an error message:

   .. code-block:: console

      git@git.ligo.org: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
      fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

   Then you need to use the HTTPS URL, e.g., replace the first line above with

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby.git
